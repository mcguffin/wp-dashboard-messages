== Installation ==

Just follow the standard [WordPress plugin installation procedere](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins).

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

I personally prefer GitHub. The plugin code is here: [GitHub](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-dashboard-messages)

= I want to use the latest files. How can I do this? =

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:
1. If you haven't already done: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
2. in the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins' directory
3. type 'git clone git@github.com:mcguffin/wp-dashboard-messages.git'
4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested on Your WP-Version) type 'git pull'.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I let You know? =

Either post it on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-dashboard-messages) or—if you are working on a cloned repository—send me a pull request.
