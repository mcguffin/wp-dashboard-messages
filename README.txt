== Frequently asked questions ==

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

Please use the issues section in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-dashboard-messages/issues).

I will most likely not maintain the forum support forum on wordpress.org. Anyway, other users might have an answer for you, so it's worth a shot.

= I'd like to suggest a feature. Where should I post it? =

Please post an issue in the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-dashboard-messages/issues).

= The plugin works pretty well for me. Any way I can show my appreciation? =

Thanks! As a well trained person living in a rich country there is only little I could wish for.
Well, to be honest there is something. As a well known fact today's internet is dominated by only a few major corporations, monitoring all of your behaviour gaining more and more power that way.

Only few organizations have the guts to stand up against this power. In europe—in Austria to be precise—there is *None of you Business* who take whatever legal action they can to put mass surveillance corporations in their place. 

So, if that little piece of software was able to help you, you can do me—and yourself—a favor and place a donation at [NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en/support-us).
